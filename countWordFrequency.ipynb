Each Bengal tiger has a unique stripe pattern, much like a human's fingerprints, which helps scientists identify individuals in the wild. These stripes also serve as excellent camouflage, making them difficult for prey to spot in the dappled light of forests and tall grasslands. Unlike many other cats, Bengal tigers are exceptional swimmers and are known to inhabit the Sundarbans mangrove forest in India and Bangladesh, the only mangrove habitat in the world where tigers are found.\"\n",
